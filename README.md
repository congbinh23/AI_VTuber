# AI VTuber GameBot - Graduation Project Roadmap & Design Document

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Title:** AI VTuber GameBot - Interactive AI VTuber that Watches, Learns, and Plays Games

**Objective:**  
Create an AI VTuber that can:
- Watch gameplay videos, read gaming documents.
- Learn game mechanics, strategies, and meta trends.
- Play the game (semi-autonomous).
- Interact with the audience via VTuber persona.

**Target Platform:** PC (Windows)

**Technology Stack:**  
- AI Models: GPT-4 (text), Whisper (speech-to-text), Stable Diffusion (visual assets), OpenCV (gameplay analysis)  
- Framework: Python (backend processing), React (control dashboard)  
- Game Interface: Computer Vision + Macro Command Execution  
- VTuber Animation: VTube Studio API (or similar)  
- Document Parsing: LangChain + PDF OCR (for reading game guides, patch notes)

## 2. Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Gameplay Analysis | Use OpenCV to capture screen data and identify game events (health bars, enemy location, etc.) |
| Video Learning | Extract subtitles + action sequences from gameplay videos to learn strategies. |
| Document Learning | Feed patch notes, guides into AI for understanding game meta. |
| Interaction | VTuber reacts to in-game events, chats with viewers using GPT-generated responses. |
| Decision Engine | Combines all learned data to make real-time gameplay decisions. |

## 5. Technical Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| Real-time Analysis Lag | Use multi-threading to separate capture, analysis, and action layers |
| Complex Game Events | Pre-train AI on video datasets with labeled events (kills, deaths, objectives) |
| Document Comprehension | Use LangChain to chunk and summarize large documents for faster training |
| VTuber Animation Sync | Use event hooks to trigger animations immediately when conditions are met |

---

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy:** Avoid streaming unnecessary player data.
- **Injection Prevention:** Sanitize any external document input.
- **Model Bias Check:** Review model responses for toxicity or unfair bias.
